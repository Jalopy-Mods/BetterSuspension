This mod makes the Laika's suspension considerably softer, making it a bit closer to how it was in Jalopy 1.0.

### How to install
1. Make sure you have [JaLoader](https://github.com/theLeaxx/JaLoader) 1.0.0+ installed
### Manual method: Place it in your mods folder (default is `Documents/Jalopy/Mods`)
### Automatic method: 
* **This requires that the `Enable JaDownloader` setting in `Modloader Options/Preferences` in-game is set to `Yes`**
* Open this link in a browser:
* `jaloader://install/jalopy-mods/BetterSuspension`
